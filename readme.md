# Terraform modules repository

This repository contains my own module for Azure deployment through Azure

## Repository organization

The repository is currently organized as follow:

- **Modules_building_blocks** folder contains mostly single resource in each module, as much as possible with as much as paramaters declared. Those modules are not updated any more, because it was when I was young and naive about terraform module concepts ^^
- **Custom_Modules** folder contains more complex modules abstracting more resources
