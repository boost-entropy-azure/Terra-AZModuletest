# Terraform modules repository

This repository contains my own module for Azure deployment through Terraform

## Repository organization

The repository is currently organized as follow:

- **Modules_building_blocks** folder contains mostly single resource in each module, as much as possible with as much as paramaters declared. This is mostly deprecated and will disappear at one point. There's no need to do a module of 1 resource only right. ^^
- **Custom_Modules** folder contains more complex modules abstracting more resources. This shoud contain more module as time pass, depending on my willingness to ork on it :p
